I have two dogs named Echo and Ace (Echo recently got surgery).
I like to bike ride when I can and I enjoy gaming.
I once biked for 22 miles.
I kind of already added information about my pet, so I'll talk about my friends.
We normally have everyone over for a small party once a month (not in October though because our dog is in recovery).
Some of them are already married and another is currently living in Florida (hopefully they are doing well).
